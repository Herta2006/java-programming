1. Get board, colour, declare and initialize decision variables
2. If the board is empty, make some move in the middle four squares.
3. Otherwise scan every valid coordinate and record statuses in status array
4. Go through the status for every position

	a) If playing in this position results in a win, assign a rank of 1
	b) If this position is the last free spot in a row occupied entirely by 
	opponent tokens, and this is a playable position, assign rank 2. 
	Otherwise if the above position is not playable, record the position 
	below it as a badMove.		
	c) If the position would make two or more rows of three that are both 
	winnable or blockable on the next turn, assign rank 3.
	d) If the position blocks two or more otherwise unblocked rows of two 
	opponent tokens, assign rank 4.
	e) If the position makes a row of three counters not blockable on the 
	next turn, assign rank 5.
	f) If the position makes two or more unblocked rows of two player tokens, 
	assign rank 6.
	g) If the position satisfies none of the above conditions, assign rank 7.
	
5. Rank the moves from lowest to highest rank. Order of moves of same rank does not matter.
6. Take the first move. If it is not a badMove or it is rank 1, play it. 
	Otherwise remove that move from the list and take the next one.
7. If no move satisfies the above conditions, then do nothing.

Note: Probably too hard to know whether a row is blockable or not
